# C++ Learning Project

I know C++ Language already, but I used this as an opportunity to learn more about making a multifaceted program that was more complex in nature.

This program works to build a trajectory table for a projectile. This table is fashioned towards bullet trajectory. I built this as I am preparing to take physics and I wanted to learn some of the math involved, and make myself familiar with programming with more difficult math and physics problems. The program is still in progress, the velocity is not working yet, but the bullet drop looks to be mostly correct, besides that the velocity affects the drop.

## Usage: 
1. Run the program
2. Enter weight in grains (e.g. 405)
3. Enter the muzzle velocity (e.g. 1330)
4. Enter the drag coefficient (e.g. 0.296)
5. Enter the cross-sectional area of the projectile (e.g. 0.16)

## Demo:
I ran the above command in my CLion terminal where I built the program. This program uses data for a .45-70 GOVT round that I found from this site: https://ammo.com/comparison/38-55-vs-45-70.

## Output:
Projectile trajectory based on weight, initial velocity, drag coefficient, and cross-sectional area:
