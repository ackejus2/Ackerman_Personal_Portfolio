# Overview

This is my first attempt at a machine learning program. 

I wrote this program so that I could better understand how a machine learning model works and learn how to train a model with images.

The program works by identifying red and green Legos in a pile of Legos given any picture and labeling them.

# Development Environment

I used Pytorch, specifically using Resnet18 for the pretrained model.

I wrote this in Python.

As this was my first ever machine learning program, I used ChatGPT to write me an initial outline of how to write a computer vision/machine learning program.
