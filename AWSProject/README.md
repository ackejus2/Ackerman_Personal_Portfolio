# C++ Learning Project

As a part of a larger project, I started to learn some AWS Sagmaker. This is not a functional program. This did not turn out as well as we had hoped and incurred costs when notebooks were running which was not very clear. Due to the overhead time to learn AWS Sagemaker, and the costs incurred, we decided to go a different direction for the project, so this was abandoned.
